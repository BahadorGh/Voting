# Sample Voting smart contract with deployment script

This project demonstrates a voting solidity smart contract using Hardhat. It comes with a voting smart contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat test (not yet)
npx hardhat node (in a new terminal)
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

To create docs from the smart contract, use below command:

```
npm run docgen
```

- [x] Deployment script, based on names in string type, and initilizing the contract constructor with them.
- [] Add unit testing
- [] Add User interface
